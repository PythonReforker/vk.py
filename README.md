### 🏠 [Homepage](github.com/prostomarkeloff/vk.py)

This library implemented all VK methods and types, based on PyDantic models.

## Install

coming soon...
```

## Usage

```sh
coming soon..
```

## Philosophy and Features
- ***k the low level API. Set async/await in your code and it will work beautifully and quickly!
  
- All typed. All objects and responses which represents API (vk.com/dev) is in library. This helps IDE`s and help you save time.
  
- All fast. VK.py uses [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) as JSON serialize/deserealize driver and [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) as event loop. This help you write effective code.

- Easily debugging. All places in code logged. Set logger level as "DEBUG" and debug your code!
